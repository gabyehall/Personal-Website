<h3>EnviroHacks </h3>

<p><i>A Hackathon for high school students, by high school students </i></p>

<p>EnviroHacks was a project I developed over the course of my senior year. I developed this event as part of my internship with 01 after competing in the 2018 eMerge Americas hackathon. My team was made entirely of high school students, and we were the only team of our kind. While we did not win, we had a blast and we're proud to make it to the end of the competition, something that not all of the adult teams did. I was lucky enough to have a company backing my participation in a competition like this, and I wanted to give more students the same opportunity.</p>

<p>This event was a coding competition for high school students meant to encourage students to pursue computer science. For this event, I recruited sponsors, competitors, speakers, and did all of the organization. Ultimately, I had students representing schools all across Miami-Dade county compete. I raised over two thousand dollars of sponsorship money and provided the competitors with a venue, prizes, and food throughout the day. I also had laptops and other materials available. </p>

<p>The event was ultimately very successful. I was fortunate to receive recognition for my work. I was a Silver Knight honorable mention for the category of mathematics. I was recognized by the school board during my high school’s graduation ceremony. I was also recognized by the National Center for Women in Technology with their regional Aspirations in Computing Award and as an honorable mention for their national Aspirations in Computing Award. </p>

<h3>Notorious S-H-E</h3>
<p><i>Notorious S-H-E, a podcast by women in STEM for future women in STEM. </i></p>

<p>In this podcast, I interview women in STEM careers to expose listeners to different career options and resources. The goal of this podcast is to show young girls that anyone, regardless of their background, can be successful in their STEM careers. Each episode features a lightning lesson and an interview with a successful woman in STEM. These lightning lessons are meant to explain different STEM topics and highlight careers similar to that of the interviewee. I also built the podcast’s website (notoriousshe.com) which features episode-specific and general resources.</p>

<p>This podcast was developed in partnership with the Sanctuary for Independent Media’s Hudson Mowhawk radio station. The Hudson Mohawk Magazine is a locally produced news hour that provides sanctuary for the discussion of a wide range of ideas. The Hudson Mohawk Magazine advances the Sanctuary for Independent Media’s organizational mission to use art and participatory action to promote social and environmental justice and freedom of expression.</p>

  <h3> Public Speaking </h3>
<p>I have been public speaking since 2019. I have spoken on various panels and at several conferences. I have detailed some of the more notable events below. I have been a speaker for the nonprofit organization CODeLLA, the National Center for Women in Technology, and others. I have been a panelist for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for various computer science and cognitive science events.</p>

<h3>NCWiT South Florida Awards Ceremony 2019</h3>
<p>On April 6th, 2019 Codella.org produced the 3rd annual  South Florida region  NCWIT Award for Aspirations in Computing, celebrating 69 young women in STEM at the Awards Ceremony held at Miami Dade College’s  MAGIC Auditorium in the IDEA Center. Three female STEM leaders inspired our honorees, family, teachers, and friends who attended.  Alongside these speakers, I was chosen as the student speaker. I gave a speech regarding the development of hackathons and the importance of computer literacy. I was also an awards winner. </p>

<h3>LatinX Future of Work Summit </h3>
<p> The Latino Tech™ “The Future of Work Summit,” powered by Codella.org at Hialeah Gardens High School was on December 14th, meant to inspire participants to dream big and be prepared for opportunities as they hear from a roster of nationally recognized female tech leaders who will show them what their jobs look like and what it took to get there.</p>
<p>For this event, I delivered a speech for a workshop entitled, Day in the Life of a Hacker for Good. You can find more information below</p>

  <h3>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</h3>
<p>As a student of Rensselaer Polytechnic Insitute, I have been encouraged to participate in as much as I can. As a result, I have done work in multiple departments, broadening my educational experience.</p>

<h3>Research Assistant: Department of Economics</h3
<p> As a research assistant for the economics department, I worked with Professor Ian Chadd to develop various projects investigating the economic impacts of gender and sexuality biases. I programmed primarily in JavaScript and Python using the oTree platform. For details regarding the programming, visit the project’s GitHub at https://github.com/ianchadd/rpi_3208  <a href=”https://github.com/ianchadd/rpi_3208” alt=”GitHub”>Click Here </a></p>

<h3>Research Assistant: Manufacturing Innovation Center</h3>
<p>For the Manufacturing Innovation Center, I worked on a Mid-Atlantic Asset Mapping project. My roles include seeking specific information that will inform the needs in the manufacturing workforce, particularly as it relates to robotics in manufacturing. I also assisted in identifying and cataloging education and training resources within the Mid-Atlantic region that provides relevant training in the subject area.</p>

<h3>Cognitive Robotics Lab</h3> 
<p>As a project for my Minds and Machines class, I worked with a team in the cognitive robotics lab to develop a robot to complete the Wumpus challenge. For this project, I worked as a programmer for both the website and the actual robot.</p>
<p>The Wumpus World challenge is an academic endeavor that combines logic, engineering, and collaboration to solve a problem. Our team went about building and coding a robot to successfully navigate a grid full of potential hazards and achieve a set goal. In the Wumpus world challenge, there is a grid with a set amount of holes, 1 Wumpus monster, and 1 pile of gold. If our robot moved to an area containing a hole or the wumpus, we lost the challenge, but if we successfully navigated the grid and found the pile of gold, we won. We can not see where these things are, so we must rely on input from the environment. When a hole is near, a breeze is felt, when the Wumpus is near, there is a smell, and when the gold is near, we see the glitter. When we moved to a new square, we would be informed of any new input, which we would then send to the robot.</p>
<p>To see the code for the robot, you can check out its GitHub at https://github.com/gabyehall/mysterymachine  <a href=”https://github.com/gabyehall/mysterymachine” alt=”GitHub”>Click Here </a></p>
<p>The website is no longer live, but you can check out its code on GitHub at https://github.com/gabyehall/Mystery-Machine-Website <a href=”https://github.com/gabyehall/Mystery-Machine-Website” alt=”GitHub”>Click Here </a></p>

<h3>Albany Can Code</h3>
<p>Through RPI, I was connected with the Nonprofit Albany Can Code. I worked as a teaching assistant for Albany Can Code through the entire year of 2021. My roles included working as a teaching assistant for their front-end web development course, teaching various assorted websites, and teaching high schoolers Saturday front-end web development courses<p>
